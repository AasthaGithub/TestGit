# Projects
A list of Mini-Projects I experimented with during BE.
 
##  Block Breaker Game In Java
A game to bounce the ball through sliding paddle & breaking bricks, earning power-ups. Implemented Multi-threading Concepts.

## Convolution Java - Image Processing
A high-pass, low-pass filter implemented by conving masks to process image apllying techniques like sharpening(Edge Detecting), Smoothening(Avg/ Noise removal)

## Android App to Connect Mentors & Mentees
GyaanFreedom, an Android App, built as BE Final Year project is an endeavor to connect Mentors & Mentees online
through a all-in-one platform where they can find resources to learn or connect mentors,
request & schedule video learning sessions. Technologies used: Android Studio, Firebase, OTP Authentication, Video Calling -WebRTC, Xammp - Local Server Database handling, Web Quiz Site.

## Board Games Review Predictor
- Dataset: 
Board games review predictor is an ML model built to predict the ratings of any board game beforehand its release
on the basis of linear regressor and random forest model trained on games dataset available on kaggle.
- Predictions: ratings of the game 
- Regression & Random Forest, Decision Tree Performance Comparison

## Iris KNN Classification
Iris Classificaton Model, which is termed as Hello World program of machine learning
here classifies flowers into the three classes or more aptly, 
predicts which class they belong to using petal and sepal length & widths as learning parameters.
